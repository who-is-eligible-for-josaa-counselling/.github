# Who is eligible for JoSAA counselling?

JoSAA Counselling 2025 is an important process for candidates looking for admission to Engineering/Technical institutions in India like IITs, NITs, IIITs, IIEST, SPAs, and other Government-Funded Technical Institutions (GFTIs). To participate in this process, candidates must meet specific eligibility requirements, which are different for each category depending on the type of institution and program they aim to join. Below is a detailed explanation of the eligibility criteria for different categories of institutions under [JoSAA](https://josaa.nic.in/).

## Key Highlight

Clearing any of the JEE Main entrance examination or JEE Advanced exam doesn’t guarantee one the opportunity to join any of the institutes admitted through [JoSAA counselling](https://josaacounselling2025.info/). Both institutions and programs have their requirements, by which candidates must comply in order to get a seat. This includes meeting the academic eligibility list, the rank requirements, and other conditions as may apply to the category of candidate to be admitted. In addition, candidates require passing all stages of the counselling process and providing necessary documents as well as paying the required fees.

Candidates who are from reserved/special categories, i.e., Persons with Disabilities (PwD) may require additional documentation. For example, candidates in the PwD category who do not possess valid UDID cards are asked to come for physical verification at designated reporting centers to prove their fitness to gain admission. Any omission in any of the requirements or failure in the verification process would lead to disqualification in the counselling process.

## Eligibility for IITs

The admission in the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) primarily depends on students' ranks in the JEE Advanced 2025 examination only. Only those candidates who get through this extremely competitive exam are given the chance for JoSAA counselling for IITs. They must meet any institute-specific criteria set by the IITs for the desired undergraduate engineering programs. For example, candidates need to have a valid JEE Advanced rank, meet the chronological age requirement, and secure a minimum percentage in class 12 or equivalent from a Board/university recognized by IITs.

## Eligibility for the NIT+ System and Other Institutes

The NIT+ system comprises National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), Schools of Planning and Architecture (SPAs), and other Government-funded technical institutions (GFTIs). To get admission to these institutions, the candidate has to secure the ranks in the JEE Main 2025 examination.

For admission to B.E./B.Tech degree courses, the candidates must appear in JEE Main 2025 Paper 1. For aspiring B.Arch or B.Plan architects and planners, the candidate must appear for JEE Main 2025 – Paper 2. These ranks are significant for qualifying the candidate and determining the number of seats during the JoSAA counselling session. It is also important to note that candidates must meet any other specific admission requirements that may be set by the respective program or institute.
